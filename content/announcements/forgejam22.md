For those who do not already know, a modding jam is an event that happens occasionally in the Modded Minecraft community.  
The goal is to create a mod in a restricted time window, with a restricted theme and with specific judging criteria.

Some modding jams are played for fun, some are played for money, some are played for prizes.

## The Theme

The theme of the Forge jam is rather specific; Item Transportation.

That means, transporting items (individually or in bulk) across the world. Land, sea, or air.  
Teleportation is technically allowed, but will affect the final score of your mod.

## Judging Criteria

We will judge submitted mods based on five main criteria:

* Creativity: how unique the idea of the mod is (whether it has not been seen before, or in other submitted mods)
* Effectiveness: how well the mod works at transporting items
* Theming: how well the mod sticks to the theme of Minecraft (or itself, should your mod focus around steam-punk airships or something.)

There are two "bonus points" categories:

* Performance: how well optimised your mod is, and whether it greatly affects frametimes or tick times.
* Compatibility: whether your mod works in large packs, has mod integrations, and doesn't use things like Coremods or Mixins.

Of course, this is the first Forge Jam and we're going to have some fun with it while we're finding our footing, so each of the judges will have their own criteria (and some of them may not be what you expect).

## Judging

Judging will be done both by the Forge Team and by the community.

In fact, the community will account for 1/3 of all votes in the jam.

More information on this, as well as a voting page where you can submit your opinions, will be published during the submission period.

## Submitting Mods

Mods must be submitted in source code. We will compile your mod from source (and thus the mod must have a valid and permissive OSS license for us to be able to judge it).

The development period for mods is between the 1st July and 29th July.  
The submission period is between the 29th and 31st July.  
The polls and final judging will be done on the 1st August.

## Prizes

Prizes are still being figured out, but we are currently expecting to be able to provide:

* A nice set of high end peripherals (mouse and keyboard)
* Some cold, hard cash
* Possibly, a "tiny potato" brick signed by the whole Forge team

More prizes and specifics will be hammered out as we continue.

## FAQ

1. Can modders team up?  
        **Yes. In fact, you'll probably be better off working in small teams.**
2. Can we use a library mod to help implement?  
        **Yes. Though, it will negatively affect your score.**
3. Can we add the jam feature to an existing mod?  
        **Yes. Though again, it will negatively affect your score.**
4. Can we use MCreator or other mod toolkits?  
        **Yes. Though, yet again, we will be taking the quality of the source code into account when judging, so this will be putting you at a huge disadvantage.**

## TL;DR

Forge's Jam starts now, and ends on the 29th July.  
The theme is Item Transportation.  
Submission portal will be opened on the 29th.  
Judging will be done based on creativity, effectiveness and theming.  
The community will be able to help judge the mods that are submitted.  
Prizes will be given to the winner, and possibly some runner-ups.
