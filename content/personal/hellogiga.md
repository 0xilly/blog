This is a post purely from the github web editor. I apparently can't use hugo shortcodes, but i can totally just smack together a basic post.

I even have some basic formatting!


```java
System.out.println("I can even put java snippets in!");

Not such a big hardship to use the GitHub web editor. Just copy the front matter, and edit the Date field.
