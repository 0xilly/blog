okay hear me out  
what if forge had a blog  
where we can post things  
and get in touch with the community  
and update people on what's happening with the project  
we could use it as a central place to post updates that happen to forge  
and it can be mirrored to Discord and Twitter as part of FUN  
we can also use it for personal things related to the project;  
say, someone works on a really cool new feature or debugs a really hard issue.  
they can make a writeup if they want and post it to the blog for everyone to read.  
how cool would that be?
