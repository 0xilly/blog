### Intro

The 1.19.3 caused us much turmoil, and almost changed how we treat LTS and major versions entirely.
It has quite a few breaking changes, and modders should be expecting a large port if they have lots of items and worldgen.

However, not quite as breaking as some major versions we've had, such as 1.17, or minor versions like 1.16.2.

### Changelog

* Created a CreativeModeTabEvent to register creative mode tabs and populate entries per tab
